This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`c3`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/get-started/c3).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```


After doing this you can run the `dev` or `preview` script and visit the `/api/hello` route to see the example in action.

Finally, if you also want to see the example work in the deployed application make sure to add a `MY_KV_NAMESPACE` binding to your Pages application in its [dashboard kv bindings settings section](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/pages/view/:pages-project/settings/functions#kv_namespace_bindings_section). After having configured it make sure to re-deploy your application.
